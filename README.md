## Hi! 👋

I'm Natasha, a Computer Programming & Analysis student @ Seneca Polytechnic.

I enjoy coding and designing interfaces that appear effortless yet user-friendly.

If I am not working on my school responsibilities or building my projects, you'll find me watching random travel and internship vlogs, capturing raw images of nature or people, going on a matcha run (a must), hitting the gym, or hanging out with my family and friends.  

🔭 I’m currently working on building my first-ever project! <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Object-Oriented Programming, React, and Python <br>

     - Studio Ghibli films are my favourite animations💗
